8/25/2015 - version 2.6
1. add SSD!!, totally reprogramed the way to save tiff files, improved at
    least five fold in image saving speed
    a. in zscan, it is saving while it is running
    b. in movie, it is saving while it is running too, might run into buffer    
        overflow
2. add tiff tag files to automatically generate tiff tag
3. add the way to change illuminations
4, add the parameter saving protocols
5. change the default camera dynamic range to 16 int, low noise high capacity
6. fixed the snapimage bug, need to set trigger mode to software mode before imaging
7. image transposed for ooptimized speed
8. changed from tif to BIGTIFF files, can save above 4G, ImageJ needs bioformat
    plugin to read those files

9/2/2015
1. getting rid of unneccessary variables in main buttons
2. build in z center find function
3. build in biology sample options, and selector
4. move all the possible options to class properties
5. add Go function to move stage
6. add function to move z stage to zcenter
7. build Zfocus function to take a zstack and focus to center
